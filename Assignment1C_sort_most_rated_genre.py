    # in order to know the amount of ratings per genre we need to join two datafiles u.data for the ratings and u.item for the movie details
    # a quick google how to join two datasets leads us to the following code: https://gist.github.com/rjurney/2f350b2cbed9862b692b
    # this code is essential as it shows how mrjobs loads in datafiles.

    # which in my eyes is completely at random, when doing a yield directly after loading them in, the lines of the datasets are unordered and randomly placed in the output.
    # for this we need a solution. 
    # First, we need to determine beforehand which delimiters that are being used in the datasets, and how many columns each dataset has.
    # this way we can recognize which lines are from which dataset, choose which columns we wanna use and give each line their corresponding name / category.

    # this mapper yields the following {key:value}-pairs
    # {movieID:["rating", rating_value]} 
    # "1000"	["rating", "3"]

    # {movieID:["metadata", genre_value1, genre_value2, genre_value3...]}
