## <a name="2."></a>**2. General Overview**

This repository is an assignment for the course Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) of the minor Big-Data at Inholland university of applied sciences.

Originally this course consists of 3 assignments, but due to unforeseen circumstances the lecturer decided to drop the 3rd assignment.
This is why you'll only find two assignments in this repository.

The grading of the assignmnents is as follows:

- Each assignment has a maximum grade of 10 points, so the total maximum grade is 30 points (eventhough the 3rd assignment is dropped)
- The average of Assignment-1 and Assignment-2 makes up the grade for the dropped 3rd assignment.
- Assignment-1
  - Assignment A (Assignment1A_Ratings.py) is the base for assignment-1 and for a grade 6/10
  - Assignment B (Assignment1B_show_and_sort.py) is an extra assignment to score 2 extra points on the grade
  - Assignment C (Assignment1C_sort_most_rated_genre.py) is an extra assignment to score 2 extra points on the grade
- Assignment-2
  - Assignment A
